## The Start of a New Project 

Heey there, 

I am currently immersed in an exciting project - building a static site generator a.k.a. SSG, guided by the comprehensive curriculum at boot.dev. A SSG is a software application that creates static HTML pages from raw data and templates. It's a powerful tool that combines the advantages of server-side rendering with the performance and security benefits of static sites.

## The Journey

This project has been an interesting detour in my programming journey. It all started when someone on Discord mentioned GitHub Pages and its free hosting capabilities while i was (read: am currently) working my way through the course The idea of having my own site, hosted for free, was too good to pass up. This led me to create this site and dive into the world of static site generators. (read: skim the surface)

## The Challenges and Fun

This is one of my more complex projects, which makes it both fun and challenging. The complexity has pushed me to learn new concepts, improve my problem-solving skills, and think more deeply about code design. I'm getting assistance from both the boot.dev AI called Boots and GitHub Copilot, which has been incredibly helpful.

## Future Plans

I'm also considering embarking on a completely unguided/unassisted project soon. I believe this will be a great opportunity to apply everything I've learned and gain more confidence in my programming skills.

## Project Repository

The project files for the site generator can be found [here](https://github.com/mehrain/static_site_gen). I welcome any input or suggestions on how to improve the project :smiley: Please note, this is still a work in progress, and I'm excited about the journey ahead.

## Conclusion

This project has been a great learning experience so far, and I'm looking forward to continuing this journey. I'm excited to see where this project will lead and how much I will learn along the way. Thank you for joining me on this adventure!
