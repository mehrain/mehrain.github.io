### The Role of AI in Learning

Lately, I have heavily relied on AI to assist me in overcoming challenges and comprehending complex code segments. Boots, an AI assistant, has been instrumental in explaining concepts in a way that resonates with me, while Co-pilot AI has been invaluable in helping me write code. However, I have come to realize that there is a potential issue.

### The Challenge: AI vs. Critical Thinking and Deep Learning

With the increased involvement of AI in my current SSG project, I have become concerned that I may be overly dependent on it. I fear that I have neglected to utilize my own logical thinking and deep learning abilities to solve the problems I encounter. It seems as though I have been using AI as a crutch, hindering my personal growth and learning potential.

### The Solution: Striking a Balance

To address this concern, I have made the decision to reduce my reliance on AI and take a more hands-on approach. While I will still leverage AI to aid my understanding of complex code segments, I will refrain from using it to write code for me. By doing so, I believe I will enhance my learning experience and develop the skills necessary to independently tackle the challenges I face. Additionally, I find Boots to be a more preferable assistant compared to Co-pilot, as Boots excels at providing explanations tailored to my understanding, rather than simply providing answers.

### Conclusion

Although AI is a powerful tool that I anticipate utilizing in the future, I have chosen to limit its use for now. This decision will compel me to learn and grow independently, fostering a deeper understanding of software development. That being said there is a certain irony to mention: This post was written with the help of Co-pilot AI. (But hey, its not a crutch if you're aware of it, right?)
