# About me

Allow me to introduce myself. I am Marijn Rovers, also known as Mehrain in the online world. In 2013, at the young age of 18, I completed my sysadmin education. Computers, coding, and networking have always fascinated me, driving my passion in these fields.

Although I have not yet worked full-time in the industry, I have been actively involved in coding for quite some time. It all started when I was just 13 years old, tinkering with JS config files and creating and modifying modded game servers. Over the years, I have become familiar with various frontend frameworks, including the one you are currently reading.

While working as a network coax engineer at VodafoneZiggo through a subcontractor, I have recently embarked on a coding journey. With great enthusiasm, I am actively learning and improving my abilities, eager to embrace the best practices in the field.
