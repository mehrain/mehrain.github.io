Allow me to introduce myself. I am Marijn Rovers, also known as Mehrain in the online world. In 2013, at the young age of 18, I completed my sysadmin education. Computers, coding, and networking have always fascinated me, driving my passion in these fields.

Although I have not yet worked full-time in the industry, I have been actively involved in coding for quite some time. It all started when I was just 13 years old, tinkering with JS config files and creating and modifying modded game servers. Over the years, I have become familiar with various frontend frameworks, including the one you are currently reading. That being said, front end development is not my primary focus. I am more interested in backend development.

Previously, I worked as a network coax engineer at VodafoneZiggo through a subcontractor. However, I realized that network engineering (in its physical form) wasn't my passion, which led me to embark on a coding journey. With great enthusiasm, I am actively learning and improving my abilities, eager to embrace the best practices in the field. I hope someday to be in a envoirment where i can work with gifted people and learn from them.

Currently, I am enrolled in a coding bootcamp called Boot.dev to further develop my skills in these areas. Boot.dev provides structured learning, mentorship, and hands-on projects to enhance my programming abilities. You can check out my progression and earned certificates on [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/u/mehrain) to learn more about my progress.
